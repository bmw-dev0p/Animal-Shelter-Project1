# Animal-Shelter-Project1
edX Coding Bootcamp Group Project 1

## Description

Our project is an animal adoption website meant to make the process fun while still being as informative as possible. we have a front page that shows dog houses with each avalible pets picture as well as their name. when you hover over the door you should be met with a link you can click that leads to another page with all the avalible pets information. 

We were motivated to create this website as our group project because we figured we would be able to implement everything we have learned so far into the course as well as adding things we learn on our own to add character and make it our own!

As a local Animal shelter,
I want to host a website that advertises the animals we are currently housing
So that customers can meet our animals, learn basic info about them, and choose whether or not to adopt them into their home.
