        <button class="accordion">Are you a "No-Kill" Shelter?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Snuggle Squad Adoption Center, with the support of the community, has been able to reach lifesaving
                milestones in recent years. In fiscal year 2022 the shelter achieved live release, through adoption,
                reunification and rescue placement, for 95% of the dogs and 88% of the cats.
            </p>

            <p>
                Snuggle Squad Adoption Center does not identify as "no kill," a term that is ambiguous, as there is no
                clear and legal definition for the term.
            </p>

            <p>
                SSAC is an open admission shelter, meaning no animal in urgent need is turned away, regardless of health
                issue or behavior concern. Animal Services is the only open admission shelter in this county and is
                committed to being an available resource for people and animals in need.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the only open admission shelter in this area, Animal Services receives pets on all sides of the
                spectrum. While most are healthy, friendly adoption candidates, some have critical needs due to medical
                issues or pose a threat to public safety due to demonstrated aggression. A small portion of animals may
                have contagious disease that pose a risk to the other pets or may be too young to viably stay in the
                shelter. It is these animals for which there are extremely limited resources and therefore the shelter
                may need to make the difficult decision to humanely euthanize.</p>

    <section>
        <button class="accordion">How long are animals kept at the shelter?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The shelter is often asked if animals are provided a set time they are allowed to remain in the facility
                the answer is no. the shelter has had animals in its care for months at a time and will hold pets
                indefinitely as long as their medical and behavioral health remain stable and as long as space allows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stray animals are required to be held for a minimum time period, to provide a possible owner a chance to
                reclaim. The stray hold does vary dependent on a few factors.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>The standard adoption fees are $55 for dogs and $40 for cats. The shelter often offers promotions which
                may further reduce these prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fee to surrender a pet to the shelter is $15.

        <button class="accordion">Do you handle or trap nuisance wildlife?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>We do not trap nuisance wildlife. Opossums, raccoons and other wildlife are natural inhabitants of
                Florida’s landscape and it’s not unusual to see them in yards. Our primary responsibility is caring for
                the community’s dogs and cats. While we will aid injured wildlife, we will not trap and handle wildlife
                for nuisance purposes. Should you wish to report an injured animal, please call 3-1-1.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the presence of wildlife has escalated to the point you feel it is a nuisance and would like to have
                it removed, please consult with a private trapper.</p>
